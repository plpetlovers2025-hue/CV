# About Me

My name is **Catarina Marcos**, I’m 35 years old and the mother of three boys — two almost teenagers and a little one who is two years old. Life has always required me to be a natural multitasker, especially motherhood, and that has shaped the way I work: focused, organised, proactive, and able to manage multiple priorities under pressure.

I’m passionate about **animals, nature and travel**, which is how I recharge and keep my mind balanced and creative.

I naturally have a **constructive critical mindset**, something that has always guided me in the way I analyse problems and look for better solutions. This mindset translates directly into my work as a QA professional: I enjoy identifying defects, analysing root causes, improving user flows, and contributing to more intuitive, reliable and user-centred digital experiences.

I worked closely with different types of audiences over the years, which made me highly **user-focused**. I understand the impact that a good (or bad) user experience has, and I take that responsibility seriously when validating features, writing test cases or reporting issues.

I’m **autonomous, resilient, fast-learning** and very adaptable — yet I collaborate naturally in team environments. I’m comfortable analysing requirements, creating manual test cases, validating acceptance criteria, reporting defects clearly and suggesting improvements that add value both to users and to the business.

I truly believe I can bring value to any QA team through my adaptability, attention to detail, curiosity, empathy for the user, and willingness to continuously learn and improve.

All I ask for in return is the ability to **work remotely** and a reasonable level of **schedule flexibility** — for a simple and important reason: the three most important people in my life, my children, whom I want to guide and support so they can have better opportunities than I did.
